"""Graph is a data structure that consists of following two components:
- A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
- A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge.
- The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of directed graph(di-graph).
- The pair of form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v.
- The edges may contain weight/value/cost.
- Graphs can be represented by two ways:
1: Adjacency Matrix
2: Adjacency List:
